grammatike: reads citable-text data listing Greek passages to analyze. Greek
analogue of arsgrammatica's ctsdata.py.

Reads a delimited-text *source* file listing Greek passages to analyze --
each one identified by a CTS URN and paired with its own text content --
distinct from serialization.py's format (which reads/writes the *results*
of an analysis). This is meant as the input side of the same workflow: pick
a passage out of a file like this one, then hand its text and citation to
analyze_passage() exactly as if they'd been typed in by hand (see
marimo/greek_syntaxer_ctsdata.py).

File shape: one or more blocks, each introduced by the label line
'#!ctsdata' alone on its own line, immediately followed by the header line
'urn|text' (using '|' as the column delimiter by default -- pass a
different `delimiter` to read_ctsdata() if the file itself uses another
character), then one data row per passage:

    #!ctsdata
    urn|text
    urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0059.tlg030.perseus-grc2:1|τίνες ὑμῖν ... διειλεγμένοι εἰσί;

Each row's own urn column is a 5-part, colon-separated CTS URN (e.g.
'urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0059.tlg030.perseus-grc2:1'); read_ctsdata() splits it
into the first 4 parts -- rejoined with ':', plus a trailing ':' -- as
`urnbase`, and the 5th part as `citation`. For the example above that's
'urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0059.tlg030.perseus-grc2:' and '1'. This mirrors how
greek_syntaxer_workflow.py's own manual-entry form works: `urnbase + citation`
(direct string concatenation, no separator) reconstructs the full URN,
same as `input_form.value["urnbase"] + input_form.value["citation_context"]`
there.

Multiple '#!ctsdata' blocks are allowed in one file, same as
serialization.py's own blocks -- every instance's rows are concatenated, in
file order, into the one list read_ctsdata() returns, so a file assembled
by concatenating several such files' contents reads back exactly as if all
their rows had been in one block to begin with.

read_ctsdata() is deliberately strict, matching serialization.py's own
read_analyses(): a missing block, a header line that doesn't match exactly,
a row that isn't exactly 2 columns, a blank urn or text column, or a urn
that doesn't split into exactly 5 colon-separated parts, all raise
ValueError immediately, naming the offending line, rather than silently
skipping or guessing.

    default, matching serialization.py's own convention. Pass a different
    character if the source file's own text content might contain '|' (the
