Shared test helpers. Greek analogue of arsgrammatica's tests/conftest.py --
same helper names/shapes, adjusted only for grammatike's own module paths
and IMPLIED_TOKENTYPES values ("implied eimi"/"implied repetition" rather
than Latin's "implied sum"/"continued discourse").

Kept deliberately small: every DummyLM-backed test reconfigures
dspy.settings.lm before it runs, so there's no cross-test state to tear
down here (yet). If that changes, this is the place for a pytest fixture
that resets dspy.settings between tests.
